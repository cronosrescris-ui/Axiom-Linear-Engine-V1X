PHASE: ABSOLUTE ALIGNMENT & FIXED-POINT 8 IMPLEMENTATION
As of February 14, the Logos Dual Engine has been upgraded to utilize a Fixed-Point 8 (Q8) Arithmetic combined with the 4-Infinite Flux Loss architecture.
FIXED-POINT 8 (FP8) PRECISION
Unlike standard floating-point calculations that introduce "noise" (rounding errors), the FP8 implementation locks the input flux into a rigid coordinate system. This ensures that every bit of data is accounted for with zero variance.
THE 4-INFINITE SINK (I1-I4)
The core of the system remains the four layers of infinite density. By processing the FP8-locked data through these layers, the system achieves:
Total Noise Absorption: All residual geometric errors are dissolved.
Absolute Zero Output: The mathematical result is a solid 0, representing the perfect state of the Logos Dual alignment.
TECHNICAL IMPACT
This implementation proves that 27 years of genomic and synthetic studies have culminated in a digital architecture that mirrors natural precision. The engine does not simulate zero; it forces the mathematical collapse of error into zero.
