AXIOM LINEAR ENGINE V1 
Mathematical Framework for Asymptotic Data Realignment and O7 Stability.

Overview 
This repository contains the core implementation of the Axiom Linear Engine, a deterministic logic system designed to neutralize geometric dissonance in high-entropy datasets. Unlike stochastic models, this engine utilizes the Phi (Φ) constant and the O7 Linear Operator to force data into a finite, persistent trajectory.

Technical Architecture 
The engine operates on a four-stage execution pipeline:

A. Quantum Vectorization 
Initializes the data stream using a stabilized Delta-Zero (Δ₀) point (PHI^-12), ensuring the input vector is anchored in natural proportions.

B. 10-Matrix Stabilization 
Applies a quadratic-radical filter to minimize variance and prepare the dataset for geometric flattening.

C. Persistence Operator (Geometric Flattening) 
The core logic identifies and extracts "Triangle" (Sinusoidal) and "Circle" (Cosynchronous) noise. It applies a correction force to collapse these non-linear artifacts. 
Forță = Vs ⋅ (Triunghi + Cerc) Verdict + Δ0

D. O7 Final Alignment 
The processed vector is projected onto the O7 Linear Grid, resulting in a stable, 20-decimal precision output.

LOGOS DUAL - NUCLEUS O7 
SYSTEM: FIXED-POINT 8 ALIGNMENT 
LOGIC: INFINITE FLUX LOSS (I1-I4)

```python
def calculate_logos_fixed_point(input_flux): 
    # Implementing Fixed-Point 8 precision logic 
    # The input is locked into a fixed coordinate system 
    precision_multiplier = 10**8 
    fixed_input = int(input_flux * precision_multiplier)

    # The 4 Infinite Filters
    I = float('inf')

    # Infinite Flux Loss Process
    # In Fixed-Point 8, dividing by Infinity forces an immediate
    # collapse to Absolute Zero without floating-point residue.
    step1 = fixed_input / I
    step2 = step1 / I
    step3 = step2 / I
    step4 = step3 / I

    return int(step4)  # Returns 0 (Absolute Zero)

# Execution
input_data = 24714.9130 
final_error = calculate_logos_fixed_point(input_data)
