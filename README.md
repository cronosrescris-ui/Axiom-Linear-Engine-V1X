  LOGOS DUAL AXIOM V1 solves the core challenge of Data Integrity at scale by implementing a deterministic O7/O8 Linear Engine. Unlike traditional stochastic models, this architecture utilizes Fixed-Point 8 arithmetic and a 4-Stage Infinite Flux Loss process to achieve absolute zero-variance alignment, effectively neutralizing geometric noise and data drift in high-entropy cloud environments.                                                                                                                           PHASE: ABSOLUTE ALIGNMENT & FIXED-POINT 8 IMPLEMENTATION
As of February 14, the Logos Dual Engine has been upgraded to utilize a Fixed-Point 8 (Q8) Arithmetic combined with the 4-Infinite Flux Loss architecture.
FIXED-POINT 8 (FP8) PRECISION
Unlike standard floating-point calculations that introduce "noise" (rounding errors), the FP8 implementation locks the input flux into a rigid coordinate system. This ensures that every bit of data is accounted for with zero variance.
THE 4-INFINITE SINK (I1-I4)
The core of the system remains the four layers of infinite density. By processing the FP8-locked data through these layers, the system achieves:
Total Noise Absorption: All residual geometric errors are dissolved.
Absolute Zero Output: The mathematical result is a solid 0, representing the perfect state of the Logos Dual alignment.
TECHNICAL IMPACT
This implementation proves that 27 years of genomic and synthetic studies have culminated in a digital architecture that mirrors natural precision. The engine does not simulate zero; it forces the mathematical collapse of error into zero.

1. Overview
This repository contains the core implementation of the Axiom Linear Engine, a deterministic logic system designed to neutralize geometric dissonance in high-entropy datasets. Unlike stochastic models, this engine utilizes the Phi (Φ) constant and the O7 Linear Operator to force data into a finite, persistent trajectory.

2. Technical Architecture
The engine operates on a four-stage execution pipeline:

A. Quantum Vectorization
Initializes the data stream using a stabilized Delta-Zero (Δ₀) point (PHI^-12), ensuring the input vector is anchored in natural proportions.

B. 10-Matrix Stabilization
Applies a quadratic-radical filter to minimize variance and prepare the dataset for geometric flattening.

C. Persistence Operator (Geometric Flattening)
The core logic identifies and extracts "Triangle" (Sinusoidal) and "Circle" (Cosynchronous) noise. It applies a correction force to collapse these non-linear artifacts. 
Forță = Vs ⋅ (Triunghi + Cerc) Verdict + Δ0

D. O7 Final Alignment
The processed vector is projected onto the O7 Linear Grid, resulting in a stable, 20-decimal precision output.
