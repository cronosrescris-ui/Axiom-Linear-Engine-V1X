# AXIOM LINEAR ENGINE V1
> **Mathematical Framework for Asymptotic Data Realignment and O7 Stability.**

## 1. Overview
This repository contains the core implementation of the **Axiom Linear Engine**, a deterministic logic system designed to neutralize geometric dissonance in high-entropy datasets. Unlike stochastic models, this engine utilizes the **Phi (Φ)** constant and the **O7 Linear Operator** to force data into a finite, persistent trajectory.



## 2. Technical Architecture
The engine operates on a four-stage execution pipeline:

### A. Quantum Vectorization
Initializes the data stream using a stabilized **Delta-Zero (Δ₀)** point ($PHI^{-12}$), ensuring the input vector is anchored in natural proportions.

### B. 10-Matrix Stabilization
Applies a quadratic-radical filter to minimize variance and prepare the dataset for geometric flattening.

### C. Persistence Operator (Geometric Flattening)
The core logic identifies and extracts "Triangle" (Sinusoidal) and "Circle" (Cosynchronous) noise. It applies a correction force to collapse these non-linear artifacts.
$$\text{Force} = \frac{V_s \cdot (\text{Triangle} + \text{Circle})}{\text{Verdict} + \Delta_0}$$

### D. O7 Final Alignment
The processed vector is projected onto the **O7 Linear Grid**, resulting in a stable, 20-decimal precision output.
